# Waterfront Program

This is a small project which uses `d3` to generate a diagram showing site
usage across time of day, season, and day of week. Most of the action is in 
`render.js`, which has comments explaining what's going on. 

`index.html` is the container webpage, `style.css` specifies visual style, 
and `data.csv` holds the numbers!
